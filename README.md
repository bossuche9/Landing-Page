  # MY Personlal Site
  This site is built usaing HTML,CSS AND Javascrtipt.
I would recommded installing VSCODE AS it has useful extensions that can be used to run the site.
Install the live server extension on vs code.

You can then clone or download my code .
Open index.html, left click and click run with live server.
